to add the new database models to the database you need to create a new migration

1) to get the shell type python3 manage.py shell, you need to do this to sort out the database columns and rows

2) so first you will need to import the models like so : from polls.models import Question, Choice

3) next to see all of the questions type: Question.objects.all()

4) first we should import the time module from django utils, you can do it like so : from django.utils import timezone

5) then you should set a var (q) to a question like so : q = Question(question_text="What is your favorite Python Framework?", pub_date=timezone.now())

6) then you can save it like so: q.save()

7) you can also check the id like so: q.id

8) to check the text: q.question_text

9) you can also add various filter like so:
    Question.objects.filter(id=1)
    Question.objects.get(pk=1) (pk is primary key)
    q = Question.objects.get(pk=1) (pk is primary key)

10) now to add some choices

11) you can see your choices: q.choice_set.all()

12) to add a choice do this:  q.choice_set.create(choice_text='timezone', votes=0)
                              q.choice_set.create(choice_text='Color', votes=0)

13) to quit from the shell type: quit()

14) now create an admin user like so: python manage.py createsuperuser
