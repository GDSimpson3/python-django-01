set up//

1)  pip install pipenv || pip3 install pipenv || python3 -m pip install pipenv (installs pipenv)

2) pipenv shell (creates Pipfile)

3) pipenv install django (installs django in the virtualenv (gets added to Pipfile) and creates Pipfile.lock)

4) django-admin startproject pollster (pollster is the name, could be anything, and it creates the folder with the project,)
    inside the folder you will see a pollster folder and a manage.py, its kinda like an index.html in react but python, we use it to run the projects,
    in the pollster file you will see
        1)the init file is empty, duh
        2)the settings file is where you put the base directory and apps and security key for prod and db
        3)the urls file is the routes
        4)wsgi, server stuff

random knowledge: python has project (this is where you will have your website on) and apps (like templates, if you want a blog app, you will get a blog app, if you want a polls app, you will get a polls app)

5)to run server do, python3 manage.py runserver 8081, this will run the server on port 8081

6)you need to migrate it to set up some database connections, to run it: python3 manage.py migrate

7) now to create an app you need to run this and specify what is the app type: python3 manage.py startapp polls
    this will create a set of files like so:
        1)
        2)
        3)admin.py to add questions to the admin are you add them here
        4)apps.py, we dont touch, its just the LAW
        5)models.py, this is where we create our database models, here is where we will ad the questions and choices
        6) test.py, this is where tests go but we won't use them
        7)views.py, this is where you can render templates

7.1) you might need to run : python3 manage.py makemigrations

8) next, to migrate you should do this: python manage.py migrate

yarn install frozen
